# teamform-seed
## The seed project for the team form app


### Prerequisites

You need git to clone the hackust-seed repository. You can get git from
[http://git-scm.com/](http://git-scm.com/).

Please make sure that node.js (and npm) tool is installed. You can get them from [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/).


### Clone hackust-seed

Clone the teamform-seed repository using `git clone` command as follows:

```
git clone https://github.com/hkpeterpeter/teamform-seed
cd teamform-seed
```

### Install Dependencies

We have two kinds of dependencies in this project. As it is used as a course project. Key libraries with fixed version (e.g. Angular JS 1.5.7) are included to avoid discreprency 

```
npm install
```

After running this command, a new folder will be created:

* `node_modules` - It contains the npm packages for the tools we need to build and test our web application


### Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server.  The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```

After that, browse the app at `http://localhost:8080/index.html`.

### Demo (with the Coverage Report)

```

## Testing

### Running Unit Tests

 We provide a Karma configuration file to run them.

* the configuration is found at `karma.conf.js`
* all unit test cases should be written inside the folder `app/unit_tests`

The easiest way to run the unit tests is to use the supplied npm script:

```
npm test
```

This script will start the Karma test runner to execute the unit tests. In this course, we will mainly focus on the branch/statement coverage. The output files will be stored inside the app/coverage folder. 


## Serving the Application Files

While angular is client-side-only technology and it's possible to create angular webapps that
don't require a backend server at all, we recommend serving the project files using a local
webserver during development to avoid issues with security restrictions (sandbox) in browsers. 


### Running the App during Development

The seed project is pre-configured with a local development webserver.  It is a `node.js`
tool called `http-server`.  You can start this webserver with `npm start` but you may choose to
install the tool globally:

```
sudo npm install -g http-server
```

Then you can start your own development web server to serve static files from a folder by
running:

```
http-server -a localhost -p 8080
```

Alternatively, you can choose to configure your own webserver, such as apache or nginx. Just
configure your server to serve the files under the `app/` directory.
