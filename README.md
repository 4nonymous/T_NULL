# teamform-seed
## The seed project for the team forming app

### Prerequisites

Install git: [http://git-scm.com/](http://git-scm.com/).
Install node.js and npm: [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/).

### Clone the project

Clone repository using `git clone` command as follows:

```
git clone https://github.com/hkpeterpeter/teamform-seed
cd teamform-seed
```

### Install Dependencies
 
As it is used as a course project, key libraries with fixed version (e.g. Angular JS 1.5.7) are included to avoid discreprency. Other dependencies (e.g. karma toolkit, http-server...) will be installed separately:

```
npm install
```

After running this command, a new folder will be created:

* `node_modules` - It contains the npm packages for the tools we need to build and test our web application

### Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server.  The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```

After that, open a web browse with the following URL: `http://localhost:8080/index.html`.

```

## Testing

### Running Unit Tests

 We provide a Karma configuration file to run them.

* the configuration is found at `karma.conf.js`
* all unit test cases should be written inside the folder `app/unit_tests`

The easiest way to run the unit tests is to use the supplied npm script:

```
npm test
```

This script will start the Karma test runner to execute the unit tests. 
In this course, we will mainly focus on the branch/statement coverage. 
The output files will be stored inside the app/coverage folder.
